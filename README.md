# ECE Emerge Lab Manuals

ADA-compliant lab manuals for **EEC1: Introduction to Electrical Engineering**, Spring 2026, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, UC Davis.

This repository contains lab manuals for the ECE Emerge course, covering hands-on experiments with the ADALM2000 (M2K) measurement platform, signal conditioning, and the ECE Emerge Digital Scale Project.

| `Lab4/` | Lab 4: RC and RL transient response |
| `Lab5/` | Lab 5: RC/RL filters, frequency response, Bode plots |
| `Lab6/` | Lab 6: Operational amplifiers — unity-gain buffer, slew rate |
| `Lab7/` | Lab 7: Operational amplifiers — inverting, non-inverting, summing amplifiers |
| `Lab8/` | Lab 8: Instrumentation amplifier (INA125), differential signal acquisition |
| `Project/` | ECE Emerge Digital Scale Project brief and appendices |
| `md2ada.py` | Markdown to ADA-compliant HTML converter (see below) |

Each lab directory contains:

```
LabN/
  LabNInstructions.md       ← source document
  media/                    ← images referenced by the lab manual
  htmlconversion/           ← generated ADA-compliant HTML (self-contained)
```

## HTML Lab Manuals

The `htmlconversion/` folder in each lab directory contains a single self-contained HTML file suitable for upload to a learning management system (Canvas, etc.). All images are embedded as base64 data URIs — no external files are needed.

Math equations are rendered in the browser using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) loaded from CDN. An internet connection is required for math rendering.

## Converter: md2ada.py

`md2ada.py` converts a Markdown source file to an ADA-compliant HTML file.

### Requirements

```bash
pip install markdown beautifulsoup4
```

### Usage

```bash
python md2ada.py path/to/LabNInstructions.md
```

Output is written to `LabN/htmlconversion/LabNInstructions.html`.

### Features

- WCAG 2.1 / ADA compliant output: skip navigation, landmark regions, table captions, `scope="col"` on headers, high-contrast color scheme
- KaTeX math rendering: `$...$` inline and `$$...$$` display math protected from the markdown parser and rendered client-side
- Self-contained output: all images embedded as base64 data URIs
- Responsive table layout with scrollable wrappers

### Image sizing

All images use inline HTML with an explicit width percentage, making per-image size adjustment straightforward:

```html
<img src="media/file.png" alt="descriptive alt text" style="width: 60%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
```

Change the percentage in the `.md` source and re-run `md2ada.py` to update the HTML.

## Markdown Authoring Notes

- Always put a blank line between an `<img ... />` tag and the figure caption that follows it, otherwise the caption is absorbed into the HTML block and math inside it will not render.
- Keep all math expressions on a single line — KaTeX does not render inline math that spans a line break.
- Use inline `<img>` HTML for all images rather than `![alt](src)` markdown syntax, to retain per-image size control.
